# Project-Stopwatch
The stopwatch is structured in HTML and styled with specific button colours and a gradient backdrop in CSS. JavaScript provides dynamic capability to "Stopwatch.js," managing operations such as start, stop, and reset. Together, they produce a visually pleasing and dynamic timer application.
